# Star Trek Warp Calculator

This is a small Tkinter application that allows you to calculate speeds, distances, and times of TOS and TNG warp scales, along with some conversions between things like hours, days, weeks, and months and lightyears, parsecs, AU, or kilometers.

There are 5 conversion settings:

* **Warp Factor** requires a speed in *c* or km/s
* **Speed** requires a warp factor in either TOS or TNG units.
* **Time** requires a distance and either a warp factor (default) or a speed.
* **Distance** requires time and either a warp factor (default) or a speed.
* **Required Warp** requires a distance and a time.

The TNG equation used was formulated by Dominic Berry and Martin Shields.
